# Runbooks & Ops at Scale

## Summary
Operational excellence through runbooks, SRE practices, capacity planning, and incident response. Build reliable, scalable Telco cloud operations.

## Key Concepts

### Runbooks & Playbooks
- **Standard Operating Procedures**: Documented processes
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Step-by-step diagnostics
- **Incident Response**: Handling outages and issues
- **Automation Scripts**: Automated remediation
- **Maintenance Windows**: Planned maintenance procedures

### SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)
- **SLIs, SLOs, SLAs**: Measuring and targeting reliability
- **Error Budgets**: Balancing reliability and velocity
- **Toil Reduction**: Automating repetitive work
- **Blameless Postmortems**: Learning from incidents
- **On-Call Rotations**: Sustainable on-call practices

### Capacity Planning
- **Resource Forecasting**: Predicting future needs
- **Trending**: Analyzing growth patterns
- **Headroom**: Maintaining spare capacity
- **Scaling Strategies**: Horizontal vs vertical
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing resources

### Incident Management
- **Detection**: Alerting and monitoring
- **Triage**: Assessing severity and impact
- **Response**: Following incident runbooks
- **Communication**: Status updates to stakeholders
- **Resolution**: Fixing the root cause
- **Post-Incident Review**: Learning and improving

### Change Management
- **Change Requests**: Documenting planned changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating change impact
- **Rollback Plans**: Reverting failed changes
- **Testing**: Pre-production validation
- **Communication**: Notifying affected parties

### Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible
- **GitOps**: Declarative operations
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployments
- **Self-Healing**: Automated remediation
- **Chatops**: Operations through chat (Slack, Teams)

### Knowledge Management
- **Documentation**: Keeping docs up-to-date
- **Wiki**: Centralized knowledge base
- **Architecture Diagrams**: System architecture docs
- **Decision Records**: ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- **Training**: Onboarding and skill development

## Essential Tasks

1. **Write comprehensive runbooks** for common operations
2. **Define SLOs and error budgets** for services
3. **Implement automated capacity planning** and forecasting
4. **Establish incident response procedures** and on-call rotation
5. **Conduct blameless postmortems** after incidents
6. **Automate repetitive tasks** to reduce toil
7. **Maintain up-to-date documentation** and architecture diagrams
8. **Set up Chatops** for operations visibility
